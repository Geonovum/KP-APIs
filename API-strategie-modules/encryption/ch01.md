## Introduction

This module specifies the use of JWE for HTTP message and payload encryption.

## JWE encryption

## Cryptographic Algorithms

Following ENISA's Good Practises in Cryptography â€“ Primitives and Schemes [[ENISA-CRYPTO-2020]], the following algorithms found in [[RFC7518]] are selected for this profile, to be used in the following form:
* The ECDSA Algorithm with SHA-256 and P-256 Curve MUST be supported, with a key length of at least 256 bits. The value "ES256" for the alg parameter MUST be used in this case as defined in [[RFC7518]].
* The EdDSA Algorithm [[RFC8032]] using one of the curves defined in [[RFC7748]] SHOULD be supported and is RECOMMENDED for use, with a key length of at least 256 bits. The value "EdDSA" for the alg parameter MUST be used in this case and the curve shall be encoded in the crv parameter as defined in [[RFC8037]].

## Payload encryption

Payload encryption ensures the confidentiality of the payload part of the message.  When payload encrytion is considered, JWE MUST be applied with the following restrictions:
* a 
* b
