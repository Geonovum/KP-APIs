This module defines a standardized approach for performing batch operations in RESTful APIs. The objective of batching is to improve efficiency and scalability in situations where clients need to retrieve multiple resources in a single interaction.

The module specifies conventions for endpoint design, request and response formats, and error handling. By following these rules, API providers enable consistent client implementations, reduce network overhead, and improve overall performance and reliability in distributed environments.
