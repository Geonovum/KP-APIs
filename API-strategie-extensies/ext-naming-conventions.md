## Naming conventions

Although according to the URI specification [[rfc3986]] URI's are case sensitive, except the scheme/protocol (e.g. `https://`) and domain (e.g. `api.example.org`) parts, this section describes design rules related to URI's to ensure interoperability among implementations.

Specifically, design rules related to the path segments and query strings of URI's that are used to specify API resource locations are described.

### Path segments

First, in order to avoid compatibility issues with web servers and frameworks that do not handle case sensitivity of URI's well, the use of spinal-case path segments is preferred over camelCase. Also, it is a more common implementation choice for path segments than snake_case.

<div class="rule" id="api-59">
  <p class="rulelab"><strong>API-59</strong>: Use spinal-case for path segments</p>
  <p>In case path segments include compound words, the individual words are written in lower case and may be separated with hyphens. For example, a resource representing a collection of organisatie codes, results in either a path segment <code>organisatie-codes</code> or <code>organisatiecodes</code>.</p>
</div>

Also, the use of special characters used in path segments should be reduced to a minimum. Therefore, the use of diacritics and punctuation marks (other than hyphens, which are used in the spinal-case convention) must be avoided.

<div class="rule" id="api-60">
  <p class="rulelab"><strong>API-60</strong>: Normalize characters with diacritics to their base characters for path segments</p>
  <p>In case path segments include diacritics (e.g. accents), these characters are normalized to their base characters. For example, a resource <code>sc√®nes</code> results in path segment <code>scenes</code>.</p>
</div>

<div class="rule" id="api-67">
  <p class="rulelab"><strong>API-67</strong>: Omit symbols and punctuation marks other than hyphens from path segments</p>
  <p>Symbols and punctuation marks, other than hypens, must be omitted from path segments. For example:
  <ul>
    <li><code>https://api.example.org/v1/schemas</code> (<code>'</code> of schema's is omitted)</li>
    <li><code>https://api.example.org/v1/hotel-restaurants</code> (<code>-</code> is preserved)</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
</div>

With regards to naming, resources must use clear, descriptive names that expresses what the respective resources represent. Therefore, the use of nonstandard abbreviations and superfluous prefixes should be avoided in resource names.

<div class="rule" id="api-61">
  <p class="rulelab"><strong>API-61</strong>: Do not explicitly indicate that a resource is an API</p>
  <p>Use resource names as path segments (e.g. <code>gebouwen</code>) and do not explicitly mention that the resource is an API in the name (e.g. <code>gebouwen_api</code>).</p>
</div>

<div class="rule" id="api-62">
  <p class="rulelab"><strong>API-62</strong>: Do not use file extensions in path segments</p>
  <p>Preferably use content negotiation using the <code>Accept</code> header</p>
</div>

<div class="rule" id="api-63">
  <p class="rulelab"><strong>API-63</strong>: Do not use nonstandard abbreviations as resource names</p>
  <p>Avoid using nonstandard abbreviations for naming resources (e.g. <code>/coords</code> instead of <code>/coordinates</code>). This does not apply to standard or broadly used abbreviations (e.g. <code>bagNummeraanduiding</code>).</p>
</div>

### Query parameters

<div class="rule" id="api-69">
  <p class="rulelab"><strong>API-69</strong>: Use lowerCamelCase for query parameter keys</p>
  <p>Keys of query parameters must be written in lowerCamelCase. This naming convention aligns nicely with JSON property names and plays well with client side libraries such as JavaScript. Query parameters should not be prefixed with an underscore (e.g. <code>_sort</code>), but in case prefixing elements with underscores is required (e.g. for data API's where field names are dynamically defined by clients or to align with HAL conventions), an underscore prefix must only be used to denote meta-parameters such as `_sort`, `_expand` and `_filter`.</p>
</div>
