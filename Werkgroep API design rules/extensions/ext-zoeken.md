## Search

<p class='warning'>This extension is in development and may be modified at any time.</p>

Sometimes, straightforward filters are not sufficient and the capabilities of full-text search engines are required. APIs support full-text search using the query parameter `zoek`. The result is returned in the same representation.

> [API principle: Use the query parameter `zoek` for full-text search](#api-32)

Examples combining filtering, sorting, and searching:

|Request|Explanation|
|-|-|
|`GET /aanvragen?sorteer=-wijzigingDatum`|Retrieves a list of *aanvragen* sorted by *wijzigingsDatum*  in descending order|
|`GET /aanvragen?status=gesloten&sorteer=-wijzigingDatum`|Retrieves a list of *aanvragen* filtered by the *status* property set to *gesloten* and sorted by *wijzigingsDatum*  in descending order|
|`GET /aanvragen?zoek=urgent&status=open&sorteer=-prio,aanvraagDatum`|Retrieves a list of *aanvragen* containing the word *urgent* and filtered by the *status* property set to *open*. The list is sorted by *prio*  in descending order and subsequently sorted by *aanvraagDatum*  in ascending order.|

### Wildcards

APIs supporting full-text searching may take two types of wildcard characters:

- `*` Matches 0 or more (non-space) characters
- `?` Matches exactly one (non-space) character

For example, `he*` matches any string starting with `he`, like `hek`, `hemelwaterafvoer`, et cetera. The search string `he?` only matches 3-letter strings that start with `he`, like `hek`, `heg`, et cetera.

> [API principle: Support both `*` and `?` wildcard characters for full-text search APIs](#api-33)

Find below some base rules for wildcard searches:

- A search term may contain multiple wildcard characters.
- A search term may contain a combination of wildcard characters. For example `m*??` matches any string that starts with `m` and has three or more characters.
- Spaces (URL-encoded as `%20`) are used as word boundaries and wildcard matching only operates within a single word. For example, `r*te*` matches the string **`r`**`uim`**`te`**`lijk`, but not the phrase **`r`**`uimte` **`te`**`kort`.
- Wildcards only operate on fields that contain alphanumerical values.  

### Aliases for common queries

To improve the API experience, common queries should be provided as end point. For example, *aanvragen* that have the *status* property set to *gesloten* and sorted by *wijzigingsDatum* in descending order, i.e. recently closed applications, can be retrieved using the following end point:

`GET /aanvragen/recent-gesloten`
