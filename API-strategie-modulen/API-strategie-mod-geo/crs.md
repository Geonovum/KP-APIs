# Coordinate Reference System (CRS)

A Coordinate Reference System (CRS) or Spatial Reference System (SRS) is a framework to measure locations on the earth surface as coordinates. Geometries consist of coordinates. To be able to measure the geometry's coordinates on the earth surface a CRS is required in conjunction with the coordinates.

CRSs are uniquely identified by means of a Spatial Reference System Identifier (SRID).
SRIDs may refer to different standards, for example EPSG Geodetic Parameter Dataset or Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC).

For a detailed description of CRSs see [[hr-crs]].

## CRS discovery

A client shall be able to determine a list of CRSs supported by an API.

<div class="rule" id="api-geo-5">
  <p class="rulelab"><strong>API-GEO-5</strong>: Provide a list of all CRSs that are supported by the API</p>
  <pre>
  // GET /api/v1/collections:</pre>
  <h4 class="rulelab">How to test</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Send a request to the <code>/collections</code> endpoint.</li>
  <li>Validate that the returned document contains a <code>collections</code> object with the <code>crs</code> property.</li>
  <li>Validate that the <code>crs</code> property contains an array with CRS references in the form of URIs.</li>
</ul>
</div>

According to [OGC API Features - part 1 - 7.13. Feature collections](https://docs.opengeospatial.org/is/17-069r3/17-069r3.html#_collections_) an OGC API Features API shall provide a GET operation on the `/collections` endpoint which returns a collections object.

OGC API Features - part 2 - Coordinate Reference Systems by Reference [[ogcapi-features-2]] describes how to support different CRSs in your geospatial API. According to [OGC API Features - part 2 - 6.2 Discovery](https://docs.ogc.org/is/18-058/18-058.html#crs-discovery) and in particular [Global list of CRS identifiers](https://docs.ogc.org/is/18-058/18-058.html#_global_list_of_crs_identifiers), a collections object provided by the API's `/collections` endpoint may contain a global list of supported CRSs by means of the `crs` property. This global CRS list applies to all feature collections delivered by the API, unless otherwise stated at a feature collection.

Each feature collection mentioned within the `collections` list may also contain a `crs` property if the set of supported CRSs differs from the global CRS list.
If a feature collection supports exactly the same CRSs as mentioned in the global CRS list, then the `crs` property may be omitted.

If a feature collection supports additional CRSs compared to the global CRS list in the collections object, then a reference to the global CRS list `#/crs` may be added in the feature collection object and the URIs of the additional CRSs are added to the CRS list in the `crs` property of the feature collection.

If a feature collection supports a different set of CRSs than the set defined in the global CRS list, then a reference to the global CRS list is omitted and only the URIs of the supported CRSs are added to the CRS list in the `crs` property of the feature collection.

For clients, it may be helpful to know the CRS identifier that may be used to retrieve features from that collection without the need to apply a CRS transformation.

<div class="rule" id="api-geo-6">
  <p class="rulelab"><strong>API-GEO-6</strong>: Make known in which CRS the geospatial data is stored.</p>
  <h4 class="rulelab">How to test</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Request each collection in the <code>/collections</code> endpoint.</li>
    <li>Validate that each returned collection contains the <code>storageCRS</code> property.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

If all features in a feature collection are stored using a particular CRS, the property `storageCRS` shall be used to specify this CRS, in accordance with [OGC API Features - part 2 - 6.2.2 Storage CRS](https://docs.ogc.org/is/18-058/18-058.html#_storage_crs). The value of this property shall be one of the CRSs supported by the API and advertised in the CRS list as stated in requirement 4 of [OGC API Features - part 2 - 6.2.2 Storage CRS](https://docs.ogc.org/is/18-058/18-058.html#_storage_crs). If relevant, the epoch should also be specified, using the `storageCRSCoordinateEpoch` property. For an explanation of the use of epochs with CRS, see the CRS Guidelines [[hr-crs]]. 

## CRS negotiation

The default CRS for GeoJSON and for OGC API Features is WGS84 with coordinate order longitude-latitude, also referred to as "CRS84". This refers to an ensemble of global CRSs that can be applied world-wide. Due to the datum and the tectonic displacements it is not accurate enough for local coordinate reference systems like ETRS89 (EPSG:4258, European), or RD/Amersfoort (EPSG:28992, Dutch). For more information about coordinate reference systems, read the Geonovum guidelines on CRS [[hr-crs]].

<aside class="note" title="Convention">
When referring to a coordinate reference system using its code in the rest of this chapter, this is meant to refer to both the 2D and 3D variant of the system in question. E.g. when "RD" is mentioned, this should be taken to mean "RD or RD-NAP"; when WGS84 is mentioned, this should be taken to mean "WGS84 or WGS84h". 
</aside>

Since most client-side mapping libraries use WGS84, the W3C/OGC [Spatial Data on the Web](https://www.w3.org/2021/sdw/) working group recommends to use this as the default coordinate reference system. Thus, spatial data can be mapped without any complex transformations. The API strategy caters for this supporting not only ETRS89 and RD/Amersfoort, but also WGS84 and Pseudo Mercator (EPSG:3857).

The *default* CRS, i.e. the CRS which is assumed when not specified by either the API or the client, is CRS84, in line with GeoJSON and OGC API Features. 

<div class="rule" id="api-geo-7">
  <p class="rulelab"><strong>API-GEO-7</strong>: Use <a href="http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/OGC/1.3/CRS84">CRS84</a> as the default coordinate reference system (CRS).

  <ul>
    <li>Request spatial data from the API without specifying a coordinate reference system.</li>
    <li>Validate the retrieved spatial data using the CRS84 reference system (for 2D geometries) or the CRS84h reference system (for 3D geometries).</li>
  </ul>
</div>

In addition, support for ETRS89 and/or RD is required. 

<div class="rule" id="api-geo-8">
  <p class="rulelab"><strong>API-GEO-8</strong>: Use ETRS89 and/or RD when required, as these are the preferred coordinate reference systems (CRS) for Dutch geospatial data. Follow the Dutch Guideline for the use of CRSs [[hr-crs]].</p>
  <p>General usage of the European ETRS89 coordinate reference system (CRS) or RD/NAP is preferred, but is not the default CRS. Hence, one of these CRSs has to be explicitly included in each request when one of these CRSs is desired in the response or used in a request.</p>
  <h4 class="rulelab">How to test</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Request spatial data from the API, specifying ETRS89 and/or RD as coordinate reference system.</li>
    <li>Validate the retrieved spatial data using the coordinate reference system used in the request.</li>
  </ul>  
</div>

The guiding principles for CRS support:

- Source systems record coordinates as they enter the system;
- The default CRS, CRS84, is listed first in the list of supported CRSs in the API; if the consumer does not specify the CRS it is assumed it uses the default.
- Coordinate reference systems API strategy: request/response in RD; ETRS89; CRS84; Pseudo  Mercator;
- Use the latest version of [RDNAPTRANSâ„¢](https://docs.geostandaarden.nl/crs/crs/#transformatie-en-conversie-tussen-rdnap-en-etrs89) to transform RD to ETRS89 (correction grid);
- Which CRSs are supported in an API depends on context (e.g. user requirements) - see [Spatial Data on the Web Best Practice 7: Choose coordinate reference systems to suit your user's applications](https://www.w3.org/TR/sdw-bp/#bp-crs-choice) [[sdw-bp]];
- Exchange format (notation) ETRS89 and WGS84 longitude latitude in decimal degrees: DD.ddddddddd (for example: `5.962376256, 52.255023450`)
- Exchange format (notation) RD and Pseudo Mercator X Y in meters: `195427.5200 311611.8400`

The CRS can be specified for request and response individually using parameters or headers.

  <p>Perform the same test  for the <code>filter-crs</code> parameter, if the server supports other types of geospatial filters.</p>
</div>

If a bounding box or geospatial filter is sent to the server without these parameters, the default CRS, CRS84, is assumed.

If an invalid value, i.e. a CRS which is not in the list of supported CRSs, is given for one of these parameters, the server responds with an HTTP status code `400`.

In an API that supports transactions, POST requests with geospatial content in the body may be sent by a client to the server. In that case, it is necessary to indicate the CRS used, unless CRS84, the default CRS, is used.

The API should be able to handle the following scenarios based on the rules stated above: 

| Scenario                                        | Explanation |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| No geometry in request, no geometry in response | No CRS negotiation necessary |
| No geometry in request, geometry in response    | The client can request a specific CRS for the geometries in the response using the `crs` parameter. The server indicates the geometry CRS in the response using the `Content-Crs` header. |
| Geometry in request body, no geometry in response | The client indicates the CRS of the geometry in the request body using the `Content-Crs` header. |
| Geometry in request body, geometry in response | The client indicates the CRS of the geometry in the request body using the `Content-Crs` header, and can request a specific CRS for the geometries in the response using the `crs` parameter. The server indicates the geometry CRS in the response using the `Content-Crs` header. |
| Geometry filter in request, no geometry in response    | The client indicates the CRS of the geometry filter in the request using the `bbox-crs` parameter if a bounding box is used to filter geospatially, or the `filter-crs` parameter if another way of geospatial filtering is used.|
| Geometry filter in request, geometry in response       | The client indicates the CRS of the geometry filter in the request using `bbox-crs` or `filter-crs` as in the previous scenario, and requests a specific CRS for the geometries in the response using the `crs` parameter. The server indicates the geometry CRS in response using the `Content-Crs` header.|

Use the following URIs to specify the CRS:

|Name|Dimension|Scope|URI|
|-|-|-|-|
|Amersfoort / RD New | 2D | Dutch | http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/9.9.1/28992|

|WGS 84 / Pseudo-Mercator | 2D | Global | http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/9.9.1/3857|

<aside class="note" title="CRS support and GeoJSON">
Officially, WGS84 longitude-latitude (CRS84) is the only CRS allowed in GeoJSON. However, GeoJSON does state that using another CRS is allowed, if this is agreed between provider and consumer of the data. The API functionality described above, to negotiate the CRS between client and server, can be viewed as such an agreement. Many GIS clients can deal with GeoJSON in other CRS than CRS84.

In addition, the Geonovum CRS guidelines [[hr-crs]] describe [how ETRS89 can be treated as equal to WGS84 under certain circumstances](https://docs.geostandaarden.nl/crs/cv-hr-crs-20211125/#wgs-84-gelijkstellen-aan-etrs89). 

[[JSON-FG]] is a proposed standard extension of GeoJSON that adds CRS support.

## CRS transformation

If the requested CRS is not the same as the storage CRS, a coordinate transformation is needed. Performance is increased when the dataset is transformed in multiple CRSs and stored in advance, and not transformed at the moment the request has arrived. In case of a transformation between RD and ETRS89, it is highly recommended that this transformation uses the latest version of the procedure of [RDNAPTRANSâ„¢](https://docs.geostandaarden.nl/crs/crs/#transformatie-en-conversie-tussen-rd-nap-en-etrs89). This is certified software to transform between these coordinate reference systems.
